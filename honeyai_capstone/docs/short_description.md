HoneyAI is a multi-agent system that helps honey producers make better decisions: it estimates honey purity from easy-to-measure features, recommends optimal harvest timing with safety and sustainability checklists, and generates market-ready product listings to boost sales. The Orchestrator coordinates parallel agents (Data, Field, Market), stores history to a Memory Bank, and logs decisions for observability. The demo uses a reproducible rule-based purity model and an LLM shim for text generation, so it runs offline in a Kaggle Notebook. HoneyAI is future-ready for IoT sensor integration, real-time monitoring, and commercial deployment. This submission includes code, architecture diagrams, a demo notebook, and an evaluation rubric.
